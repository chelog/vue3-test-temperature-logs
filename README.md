# Vue 3 temperature log app
Little app made with Vue 3 + Vue Router + Vuex as a job application test task.

### How to start
```sh
pnpm i # or npm i
pnpm run dev # or npm run dev
```

### Notes
- Vuex sucks at typing, going to try [this](https://pinia.vuejs.org/introduction.html) next time when this library isn't mandatory
- Animations are a bit annoying but I tried to spice it up and show that I can work with them
- Most CSS helpers are unused â€“ I just bring them around in case of need
- Code formatting is weird at places, but I really wanted to automate this (format on save)
