# Vue 3 temperature log app
Little app made with Vue 3 + Vue Router + Vuex as a job application test task.

### How to start
```sh
yarn # or npm i
yarn dev # or npm run dev
```

### Notes
- Vuex sucks at typing, going to try [this approach](https://habr.com/ru/post/557928/) next time when this library isn't mandatory
- Animations are a bit annoying but I tried to spice it up and show that I can work with them
- Most CSS helpers are unused â€“ I just bring them around in case of need
- Code formatting is weird at places, but I really wanted to automate this (format on save)
